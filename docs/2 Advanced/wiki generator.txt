title: Personal Wiki Template

## Personal Wiki

Sometimes, we need to archive and review our knowledeg, then the Wiki would be a nice tool to do it.

But it's not a easy job to install a Wiki application, and always brings some inconvenient.

If we can keep the experience of writing with FarBox to manage your own Wiki, that would be amazing.

So we try to do it by the template API of FarBox, just about 10 lines codes!

> Of course, you should have some direcotries and documents under your site, otherwise, what you can see are just blank pages..



## Source Code

In order to reflect the template code (in Jade syntax) more directly and clearly, so tags like `html/head/body` are ignored, and no stylesheet (css/scss) files  either.

> index+category.jade, then it controls the homepage and the URLs like `/category/<direcotry_path>`.
```jade:n
if request.path == '/category/'
	+redirect('/')
entries = get_data(type='post', path=path2, limit=300).group('parent_raw_path')
for parent_raw_path, posts in entries
	if parent_raw_path
		h2= parent_raw_path.split('/')[-1]
	else
		h2 Root
	ul
		for post in posts
			li
				a(href=post.url)= post.title
```

> post.jade

```jade:n
.nav
	+bread_nav(post.raw_path.split('/')[1:].join('/'), prefix='/category/')
.post
	h1.title= post.title
	.content= post.content
```
