## How to use this document auto generator?

### Step1, understand the mechanism

FarBox can turn a folder and the files it includes into a queryable database structure, so the Web site can use the template API to get the data you need. And `position` is a metadata of a post, that you can set by you self when editing a post; and `position` is also used to sort a post list.

> In short, this `document auto generator` just a website customed by FarBox API.

### Step2, user this template

It's a easy job to clone a template in FarBox, just visiting [http://doc.farbox.com/template](http://doc.farbox.com/template), input your site domain, then your site will get the template!

In fact, the source code is very simple too, you can fetch it and modify it, here is source [https://github.com/BuildFarBox/doc.farbox.com](https://github.com/BuildFarBox/doc.farbox.com)。

Download [ZIP Package](https://github.com/BuildFarBox/doc.farbox.com/archive/master.zip), unzip it, move the diretory of `template` into a site folder of yours. Maybe you should also need to go to the site admin dashboard to set `Template Priority` to `Custom Template`.

### Step3, understand the basic rules

1. Document files should be in a directory named `docs`, the file `index.md` will be the homepage of this site;
- The left sidebar is auto generated: subfolders of `docs` is subnavigation
- If a document declared `toc: yes` in metadatas,  third-level navigation will be embedded into the left sidebar
- Both directories and files should be named in this format `number+space+name`, like `1 name`, `2 name`.



[Check here for more rules](https://github.com/BuildFarBox/doc.farbox.com/blob/master/readme.markdown), and all the ruels are controlled by the template that can be modified by yourself.

Then following the tips to pack folder into PDF, and more documents, more time needed for packing.


### Supports Multiple Languages

The root folder is `docs` by default, if there is anaother root folder named `docs-zh_cn` or `docs-us_en`, then visiting a URL plus `?lang=zh_cn` or `?lang=us_en` will hit docs-zh_cn or docs-us_en, not `docs` any more.

By default, different visitors match different root folder automatically, without modifying the URL.

### Add Comments System

Go to you site admin dashboard, and add the Diqsus ID, that's all.

But it means to the visitors, they can give a comment to your some document, the feedbacks can help you to improve the documentation.
