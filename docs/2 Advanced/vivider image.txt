## Why design it!

For most people, the photos we token in daily life, did not meat our imagination at most time. Maybe because of  environment or light, even  camara.

FarBox wants to solve it by a natural design, without focusing on editing photos or filters, but we still can get a vivider image.

After many adjustments on graphic algorithms, what we designed is really amazing for non-portraitures.

> Design, should be invisible. This is our basic principle.
